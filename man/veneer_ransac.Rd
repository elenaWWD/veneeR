\title{Fit RANSAC Circles to Tree Point Cloud Data and Calculate Radii Metrics}
\usage{
veneer_ransac(tree_f, steps, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_f}{A LAS object containing tree scan data, with `Z_cor`, `X_cor`, and `Y_cor` coordinates.}

\item{steps}{Numeric, the step size for slicing the stem along the Z-axis (e.g., 0.05 for 5 cm steps).}

\item{species}{Character, species name used to calculate bark thickness (e.g., "FaSy").}
}
\value{
A data.frame with calculated radii and other metrics at different stem heights.
}
\description{
This function uses RANSAC to fit circles to stem slices and calculates several radius-related metrics, 
such as the convex hull area, circle area, and bark thickness, at different stem heights.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'tree_f' is a valid LAS object:
radii_metrics <- veneer_ransac(tree_f, steps = 0.05, species = "FaSy")
}
