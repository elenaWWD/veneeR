\title{Remove Noise and Outliers from Tree LiDAR Data}
\usage{
veneer_noise(tree_las)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_las}{A LAS object representing a tree scan. The object must include `Verticality`, `Planarity`, and `Zref` attributes.}
}
\value{
A LAS object with noise and outlier points removed.
}
\description{
This function processes LiDAR data from a tree scan by filtering out low-verticality points, 
high-planarity points, and neighbor noise, and by removing outliers in the X, Y, and Z dimensions.
It also resets the Z coordinates using the original Z reference data.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'tree_las' is a valid LAS object with Verticality, Planarity, and Zref attributes:
clean_tree <- veneer_noise(tree_las)
}
