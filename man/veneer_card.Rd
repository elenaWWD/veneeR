\title{Compute Cardinal Directions for Tree Points with Optional Radii Recalculation}
\usage{
veneer_card(tree_f, radii, steps = 0.05, plot2d = TRUE, plot3d = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_f}{A `LAS` object or similar, containing 3D coordinates (`X_cor`, `Y_cor`, and `Z_cor`) of tree points.}

\item{radii}{A data frame containing radii information for calculating tree circular fits. Must contain columns `Z`, `X`, and `Y`.}

\item{steps}{Numeric, the height interval step (in meters) for computing directions along the tree (default is `0.05`).}

\item{plot2d}{Logical, if `TRUE`, generates a 2D plot of the cardinal directions (default is `TRUE`).}

\item{plot3d}{Logical, if `TRUE`, generates a 3D plot of the cardinal directions (default is `TRUE`).}
}
\value{
Data frame with updated `car_ang` (angle) and `car_dir` (direction) columns for each point.
        If necessary, points are interpolated to fill gaps in tree data.
}
\description{
This function calculates the cardinal directions (e.g., N, NE, E, etc.) for each point along a tree's trunk 
based on 3D coordinates and radii information. If the tree scan is incomplete, additional points are generated 
using circular fit radii. The function can generate both 2D and 3D plots of the calculated cardinal directions.
}
\details{
This function checks whether radii need recalculating based on the scan completeness.
         It assigns a cardinal direction to each point based on its position relative to the tree center at each height layer.

# Example usage:
tree_data <- readLAS("path/to/tree_points.las")
radii_data <- data.frame(Z = seq(0, 10, 0.5), X = runif(20), Y = runif(20))
veneer_card(tree_f = tree_data, radii = radii_data, plot2d = TRUE, plot3d = TRUE)
}
